##Overview
This project focusing on encryption, data handling, and object-oriented design. It includes implementation of basics encryption algorithms and utility functions for string manipulation and data conversion.
Date of Creation 2018

Key Features and Concepts

##Object-Oriented Programming

Class definition and implementation (Shell class)
Use of public, private, and protected access specifiers
Friend class declarations


##Encryption and Decryption

Implementation of multiple encryption methods (Simple, Advanced, Natago)
Use of external libraries for AES-256 and SHA-256 encryption
Custom encryption algorithms (SimpleEncryptor, H_TableEncrypt)


##Memory Management

Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (use of new and delete)
Pointer manipulation and management


##Data Type Conversion

Conversion between string and uint8_t array
ASCII value manipulation
