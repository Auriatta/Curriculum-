#C++ Network Programming and Input Simulation
##Overview
This project demonstrates a client-server application using Windows Sockets (Winsock) for network communication and Windows API for input simulation.
Date of Creation: 2015

Key Features and Concepts

##Network Programming

Use of Winsock library for TCP/IP communication
Implementation of both client and server sides
Socket creation, binding, listening, and accepting connections


##Windows API Integration

Use of <windows.h> for system-level operations
Implementation of input simulation using SendInput() function
Keyboard state detection using GetAsyncKeyState()


##Multi-threading

Use of Windows console functions for window state detection
